# SpringStrength

Penn State Rock Mechanics Laboratory

The following code was developed to determine the proper spring material and normal stress for stick-slip experiments. 

The script is written for a 5x5 Double Direct Shear Configuration. It contains simple predictions the stability transition based on 
Leeman et. al. 2016 and Scuderi et. al. 2017.

The script is for preliminary experimental deisgns.
